# Declaring Types

We have already explored the basic types of Haskell in [Basic Types](../../types-in-haskell/basic-types.md), so now we will look into how we can define our own types. There are three different ways in which we can define new types in Haskell â€“ **Type synonyms** (or **Type aliases**), **Data declarations**, and **Newtype declarations**.
