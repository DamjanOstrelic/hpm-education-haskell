**Classes** in Haskell are used to ensure that certain **methods** (functions) are supported by any type that is an instance of the given `Class` (in other words, belongs to the given class). We can think of classes as **collections of types that support the operations of that class**. Let's explore the basic built-in classes in Haskell to get a better idea.
