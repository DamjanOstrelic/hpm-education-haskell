# Introduction

As we mentioned at the start, Haskell is a **strongly-typed** __language so let's expand on it. Haskell is very serious about types and strongly-typed means that each **expression** in Haskell has an associated **type** to its value. Expression types can be basic, which are built-in the language â€“ the likes of **Int**, **Integer**, **Float**, **Double**, **Char**, **String** and **Bool**. Note that type names always start with an uppercase letter. Types can also be **polymorphic** \(which is why Haskell is also a polymorphically-typed language\), in which case they are specified through **type variables** beginning with a lowercase letter, but more on that will come shortly.
