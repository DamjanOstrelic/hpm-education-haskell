# Installing Haskell

Alright, time to finally install Haskell and start writing some code. The recommended way to install Haskell is via GHCup ([https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)), which will get you up and running quickly with several tools, most notably, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).

We mentioned at the start that Haskell is a compiled language, which means we have to compile our programs to computer code first before being able to run them. However, GHC comes with an interpreter (GHCi) which allows us to play with Haskell interactively without having to compile our code beforehand.
